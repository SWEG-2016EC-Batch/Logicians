The purpose of the program is to calculate how many miles an automobile can travel without needing to refuel,
based on the fuel tank capacity and the miles per gallon (mpg) it achieves.
Input: The fuel tank capacity in gallons.
 The miles per gallon the automobile can achieve.
Process:
The program calculates the total miles by multiplying the tank capacity by the miles per gallon.
Output:
The program outputs the total number of miles the automobile can travel without refueling.
Algorithm Design
step 1: Start
step 2: Input Prompt the user to enter the fuel tank capacity in gallons.
Prompt the user to enter the miles per gallon.
Store this value in milesPerGallon.
step 3: Process
Calculate the total miles the automobile can travel without refueling: totalMiles = tankCapacity * milesPerGallon.
step 4: Print the result: "The automobile can be driven [totalMiles] miles without refueling."
step 5: End
