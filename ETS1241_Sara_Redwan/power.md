# Power Calculator program
## Design Analysis
**Goal:** The program is designed to calculate and show the result of raising a number (base) to a specific power (exponent).
**Input:** Two numbers: the base (x) and the exponent (y).
**Process:** Calculate the power using pow(x, y). 
**Output:** Display the result, showing how x raised to the power of y equals the calculated result.

## Pseudocode
**step 1:** Start:</p>
**step 2:** Input: Prompt the user to enter the base number and store it in x. Prompt the user to enter the exponent and store it in y.</p>
**step 3:** Calculate the Power: Use the pow function from the library to calculate x raised to the power y. Store the result in result.<</p> 
**step 4:** Display the Result: Print the message displaying x raised to the power y along with the calculated result. </p>
**step 5:** End:</p>
