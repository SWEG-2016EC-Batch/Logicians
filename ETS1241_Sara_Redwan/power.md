The program is designed to calculate and show the result of raising a number (base) to a specific power (exponent).
Input:
Two numbers: the base (x) and the exponent (y).
Process:
Calculate the power using pow(x, y).
Output:
Display the result, showing how x raised to the power of y equals the calculated result.

Algorithm Design
step 1: Start:
step 2: Input:
Prompt the user to enter the base number and store it in x.
Prompt the user to enter the exponent and store it in y.
step 3: Calculate the Power:
Use the pow function from the <cmath> library to calculate x raised to the power y.
Store the result in result.
step 4: Display the Result:
Print the message displaying x raised to the power y along with the calculated result.
step 5: End:
