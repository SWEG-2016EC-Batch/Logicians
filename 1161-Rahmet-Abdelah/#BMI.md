 ### Input:
 . Weight (in kilograms)

. Height (in meters)

### Process:
Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI= w/(h*h).

Determine the weight category based on BMI:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5

Normal weight: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 24.9

Overweight: 25<=BMI <= 29.9
obesity: >= 30


### Output:
BMI and Weight category (underweight, normal weight, overweight,obsetiy)

# Algorithm

Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: declear: body weight, height, BMI, i.

Step 3: Repeat the following until i is not'0':

   Step 3.1: Print "Enter your mass in kilograms"
 
   Step 3.2: Input body weight

   Step 3.3: Print "Enter your height in meters"

   Step 3.4: Input height

   Step 3.5: Calculate BMI as BMI = body weight / (height * height)

   Step 3.6: Print "Your Body Mass Index is: BMI"

     Step 3.6.1: If BMI < 18, print "You are in under weight"

     Step 3.6.2: Else if BMI <= 24.9, print "You are in normal weight"

     Step 3.6.3: Else if BMI <= 29.9, , print "You are over weight"
     Step 3.6.4: Else  print"You are in obesity"

Step 3.7:if you want to calculate for other people insert any character or to stop enter 0"

    Step 3.7.1: Input i

Step 4: If i is not equal to 0

Step 5: End
