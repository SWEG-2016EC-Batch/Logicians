# Problem Analysis

 ### Input:
 . Weight (in kilograms)

. Height (in meters)

### Process:
Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI= w/(h*h).

Determine the weight category based on BMI:

Underweight: BMI < 18

Normal weight: 18 â‰¤ BMI < 25

Overweight: BMI >= 25

### Output:
BMI and Weight category (underweight, normal weight, overweight)

# Algorithm

Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Initialize variables: body weight, height, BMI, num.

Step 3: Repeat the following until num is 'y':

   Step 3.1: Print "Enter your body weight in kilograms"
 
   Step 3.2: Input body weight

   Step 3.3: Print "Enter your height in meters"

   Step 3.4: Input height

   Step 3.5: Calculate BMI as BMI = body weight / (height * height)

   Step 3.6: Print "Your Body Mass Index is: BMI"

     Step 3.6.1: If BMI < 18, print "You are under weight"

     Step 3.6.2: Else if BMI < 25, print "You are normal weight"

     Step 3.6.3: Else, print "You are over weight"

Step 3.7: Print "Do you want to continue? [y:n]."

    Step 3.7.1: Input num

Step 4: If num is !=y

Step 5: End
