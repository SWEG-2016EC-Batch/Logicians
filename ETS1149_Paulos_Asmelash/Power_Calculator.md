# Problem Analysis

### Input:

• A number base x

• An exponent y

### Process:

Calculate the power using the formula: power = x^y.
### Output:
• Result = x^y (x raised to y)

# Algorithm:


Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Print "Enter the base number"

Step 3: Input `x` (base number) from the user

Step 4: Print "Enter the exponent number"

Step 5: Input `y` (exponent) from the user

Step 6: If `y` is greater than 0:

    - Step 6.1: For `i` from 1 to `y` (inclusive), multiply `k` by `x` in each iteration
    
    - Step 6.2: Print "The result of the given number is x^y = k"

Step 7: Else if `y` is less than 0:

    - Step 7.1: For `i` from 1 to `-y` (inclusive), multiply `k` by `x` in each iteration
    
    - Step 7.2: Print "The result of the given number is x^y = 1/k"

 Step 8: End the program.
